# CMPS 148 Course Code
This code repository is where I will add all of the code we create in class.

## What is this website?
If you have never heard of `git`, you will!  `git` is a source code management
system used by just about every professional and hobbyist on the planet.  It
performs revision control, tracking, and code auditing for programming projects.

`git` is a command line tool, available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and other 
platforms.  It's entirely free to use.  It's complex, and the learning curve
is a little steep.  **You do not** need to learn `git` for this class - but
hopefully you are little curious!

Tutorials:  
- [Official Guide](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/)

`git` is **not** a website.  You are reading this on [github](https://github.com/). 
Github is a free platform for **hosting** `git` repositories.  It's more than just
`git`, it has project management tools, and allows you to manage teams of programmers.

For this class, if you want to access our source code from class, you can always
come to this site and view the code.  You can download individual files, and also
download the entire project as a zip file.  This is fine for our class.  If you want
to be a bit more bold, try installing `git` on your own computer, and using `git` to 
[download the project](https://github.com/scottfrees/cmps148/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).  It lets you get updates (I'll update the project weekly), and 
see specifically what has changed.

BTW - Anything posted to this website is fair for you to use during exams.

**Note** I will not regularly post source code to our Canvas page, as it's quicker and 
more accurate for me to do this with `git`.  This way, you always see the most up to date
versions of code we create in class, including any revisions I make later.  
**Bookmark** this page!
